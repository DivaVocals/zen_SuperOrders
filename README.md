This is a development version of Super Orders. If you install this on your live site, you will need to make sure that you THOROUGHLY test.

zen_SuperOrders
===============

Super Orders is exactly what its name implies: Zen Cart order management on steroids.  It's more in all the areas I always see Zen users asking for more: more navigation options, more order control, more thorough data, and more detailed reports. But it's NOT more than you can handle.

Full Documentation
==================

The full documentation to Super Orders can be found in the `/readme/super_orders_readme.html` file. To get started, be sure to extract the entire contents of the zipped file to a directory on your desktop first. Open `/readme/super_orders_readme.html` in a web browser for full instructions.
