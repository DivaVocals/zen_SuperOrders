          <legend>What is Super Orders?</legend>

          <p>Super Orders is exactly what its name implies: Zen Cart's default order
          management on steroids. It's more in all the areas Zen users are asking for
          more:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>More order control

              <ul>
                <li>"Batch Form Printing" and "Batch Status Updating" inclduing support
                for PDF invoices within "Batch Form Printing".</li>

                <li>"Batch Form Printing" and "Batch Status Updating" both offer expanded
                order search options.</li>

                <li>Generate an order "data sheet". this is basically ALL the order
                details and comments all on one form.</li>

                <li>Editing of hidden "admin only" comments</li>

                <li>Split orders allows you to split individual lines on an order. So for
                example if a customer orders 5 widgets and you've only got 3 in stock,
                you can move 2 to another order creating a child (new) order which is
                split from the parent</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>More thorough data

              <ul>
                <li>Order payment tracking -- allows shopowners to enter and track order
                payment details (check, money orders, etc.) Payments made via
                Authorize.net, Linkpoint and PayPal are entered for you automatically.
                Send customer payment notification/verifications</li>

                <li>Order refund tracking -- allows shopowners to enter and track order
                refund details. Send customer refund notification/verifications</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>More detailed reports</li>

            <li>EASY integration* with Edit Orders, and Ty Package Tracker</li>

            <li>More navigation options

              <ul>
                <li>More shortcut icons on the orders listing screen. Now there is a
                corresponding shortcut icon on each order line that matches the buttons
                that appear in the sidebox</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><small>*Edit Orders, and Ty Package Tracker MUST be installed to use these
          built-in integration features</small></p>

          <p>But it's NOT more than you can handle. The system was designed for data
          entry clerks (some of the least-technically inclined people on the planet).
          You're a Zen Cart user. You can handle it.</p>

          <p>Ready to get started? Just follow the installation instructions</p>

        <h3>INSTALLATION</h3>

        <div class="boldemphasis">
          <p>*** READ EVERYTHING IN THIS README BEFORE YOU BEGIN ***</p>

          <p>***** BACKUP YOUR STORE BEFORE YOU BEGIN*****</p>
        </div>

        <fieldset>
          <legend>New Installation or Upgrading your store to Zen Cart v1.5 with an older
          version of Super Orders installed</legend>

          <p>Here's the BEST part of the new Super Orders.. two words.. AUTO INSTALLER!!
          No more external SQL files needed to install/upgrade Super Orders.. Yep that's
          right.. TheSuper Orders install/upgrade is easier than ever!!! Whether you are
          upgrading from a previous Super Orders install or doing a vanilla Super Orders
          install, the newauto installer has got you covered. <strong>Please
          note:</strong> Uninstall is not automated. So to uninstall you will still need
          to use an external SQL file..</p>

          <p>DO NOT RUN THE UNINSTALL SQL when upgrading..<br />
          <br />
          Let me repeat..<br />
          <br />
          <strong>DO NOT RUN THE UNINSTALL SQL when upgrading!!!!!!</strong> You will
          wipe out your payment/refunds/purchase order tables.. (This is IRREVERSIBLE!!)
          Doing so will cause issues with your Super Orders v4.0 install.</p>

          <p><strong>DO NOT RUN OLDER VERSIONS OF THE INSTALL/UPGRADE SQL FILES when
          installing/upgrading!!!!!!</strong> Doing so will cause issues with your Super
          Orders v4.0 install.<br />
          <br />
          To install/upgrade Super Orders:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Unzip the package contents to a temp directory</li>

            <li>Rename the <strong>YOUR_ADMIN_FOLDER</strong> folder in the
            <strong>1_Base_Files</strong> folder to match the name of your shop's admin
            folder.. Let me repeat this as this is the one step in module installs that
            most OFTEN gets overlooked/missed:<br />
              <br />

              <div class="boldemphasis">
                Rename the YOUR_ADMIN_FOLDER folders to match the name of your shop's
                admin folder
              </div>
            </li>

            <li>Rename the <strong>YOUR_ADMIN_FOLDER</strong> folders in the

              <div class="emphasis">
                Because these are core files, they have been separated in the install
                fileset so they are easily identified. If you have installed any mods
                which make changes to the files in this folder, you will need to use a
                tool like Winmerge or Beyond Compare to incorporate those changes into
                these files.
              </div>
            </li>

            <li>Log into your store's admin before uploading the files.

              <div class="emphasis">
                If you log into your store after uploading the files, the auto-install
                will still ocurr, but you will not see the install confimation message.
                (this is because the auto-install will take place during the login action
                and the confirmation message will not display during the login process)
              </div>
            </li>

              <strong>"Files"</strong> tab should be deleted in their entirety or
              replaced with Zen Cart defaults. Do not keep "backup" copies of these files
              on your web server as they will not work with Zen Cart v1.5 and therefore
              keeping backups of them serves NO useful purpose. Keeping these files will
              in fact cause errors in your store. (Please see the <strong>"Deprecated
              files"</strong> section of the <strong>"Files"</strong> tab before
              proceeding)
            </li>

            <li>FTP the CONTENTS of <strong>[temp directory]/1_Base_Files</strong> into
            the ROOT of your Zen Cart installation. The files are already arranged
            following the Zen Cart folder structure.</li>

            <li>FTP the CONTENTS of <strong>[temp
            directory]/2_Modified_Core_Files</strong> into the ROOT of your Zen Cart
            installation. The files are already arranged following the Zen Cart folder
            structure.<br />
            <br />
            Because these are core files, they have been separated from the Super Orders
            base files. If you have installed any mods which make changes to the files in
            this folder, you will need to use a tool like Winmerge or Beyond Compare to
            incorporate those changes into these files.</li>

            <li>Once the files are uploaded, click ANY link in your store's admin, and
            the auto-installer will be triggered. If you have followed the install
            instructions, you will see the installation confirmation message.</li>
          </ol>
        </fieldset>

        <fieldset>
          <legend>Deprecated files - Delete or replace with defaults</legend>

          <p>These file(s) are from previous versions of Super Orders and are no longer
          needed for this version of Super Orders. They are safe to delete where marked
          as such. Modified core files (if included in this list) should be replaced with
          Zen Cart defaults. DO NOT keep ANY of these files as they may in fact cause
          errors in your store.</p>

          <p class="c4">As with ANY module, any files which override existing cart files
          should be examined using a tool like Winmerge or Beyond Compare to ensure that
          any other non Super Orders related modifications are included.</p>

          <legend>Configuring Super Orders</legend>

          <ol>
            <li>Configure Phone and Fax Numbers (See Figure 1 below)<br />
            The SQL file added new defines for your store's phone and fax numbers, so
            that we can display them without the address. Go into the admin and browse to
            <strong>Configuration &gt; My Store &gt; Store Fax</strong> and add your fax
            number. You'll find the line to add the phone number directly beneath it -
            <strong>Configuration &gt; My Store &gt; Store Phone</strong>.<br />
            <small class="c5"><strong>TIP:</strong> Super Orders uses these configs on
            the invoice, but you can use them anywhere you want! Just use the define
            <strong>STORE_PHONE</strong> or <strong>STORE_FAX</strong> in your own
            customizations.</small></li>

            <li>Customize Super Orders (See Figure 2 below)<br />
            Go to <strong>Admin &gt; Configuration &gt; Super Orders</strong>, you'll
            find all the configurable options in there, with explanations and
            instructions.</li>

            <li>Install "Purchase Order" Payment Module<br />
            The PO tracking system and attached reports won't work without this! Go to
            <strong>Admin &gt; Modules &gt; Payment</strong>, you should find
            "<strong>Purchase Order</strong>" at the bottom. It should look familiar when
            you install and configure it, since it mimics the "<strong>Check/Money
            Order</strong>" module. If you will not be using Purchase Orders, you do not
            need to install the Purchase Order payment module.</li>

          <p>Added customer shortcuts, one to find all orders by the customer, another to
          pull up their profile edit screen.</p>

          <p>The original <strong>"Edit"</strong> button in the sidebox has been replaced

            <li>Split Order</li>

          <p>Each brings up a popup window to edit the specified information. Submitting
          and closing the window will refresh the page to display your changes.</p>

          <p><strong>Edit Admin Comments</strong> - Allows the shopowner to edit hidden
          (admin) comments</p>

          <p>Previous versions of Super Orders allowed editing of ALL order comments. The
          Super Orders development team felt that this was not a good shop practice.
          There is no method in SUper Orders to notify customers when a previously sent
          customer comment had been altered later. Therefore, beginning with version 3.0
          comment editing was modified to restrict comments editing to admin comments
          only (hidden comments) to be edited. Editing these comments requires no
          customer notification</p>

          <p><strong>Split Order</strong> - Allows the shopowner to split items off of
          one order and onto a new order</p>

          <p>When an order is split, the ORIGINAL shipping, tax, and other order total
          values remain with the "parent" (original) order, and the "child" (new) order
          will only include the totals for the products being moved over. This allows for
          payments for paid orders being split correctly as a result. No additional order
          splits are allowed after the order is split. Additionally the grand total of
          the original order will be clearly displayed on both the parent and resulting
          child order.</p>

          <p>Why was split orders changed?<br />
          <br />
          The original split order function was modified in this version of Super Orders
          so that shopowners can easily reconcile split orders (particularly PAID split
          orders). Prior versions of Super Orders provided NO audit trail for split
          orders. One of the things which was problematic in earlier versions of the
          split orders functionality in Super Orders was HOW it split the payments and
          credits on an order. The code was written to move the product(s) selected to a
          new order and it simply copied over the original shipping, payments and credits
          to the new child order. Once an order was split multiple times, there was
          NOTHING to help shopowners clearly see which orders were split and from where.
          In order for a shopowner to reconcile several split orders against a single
          payment, the shopowner would have to adopt a seperate manual process to
          reconcile all the resulting child orders against the original order/payment.
          Super Orders provided no such audit trails</p>

          <p>The ONLY way previously to correct this was to use something like the Edit
          Orders module and manually correct the child orders. When work began on Super
          Order v3.0 it was decided to look at how to improve the split orders
          functionality. Upon really examining the split orders functionality, it became
          clear that there was an order reconciliation issue. Orders could be split until
          there was nothing left to split, but there was NO WAY to reconcile the parent
          order to the resulting child orders. For orders paid via PayPal or credit cards
          this was especially problematic. There was no clean way to tie a group of
          orders to a single payment. Shopowners would have to manually keep track of
          this themselves outside of Zen Cart, and though they certainly could use the
          order notes to "tie" the orders together, there was nothing which explicitly
          linked the parent order to the resulting child orders.<br />
          <br />
          To resolve the order reconciliation issue, starting with v3.0 of Super Orders
          the split order functionality was simplified. Instead of splitting orders to
          infinity and back a better way to explicitly link a parent order to it's child
          order and clearly show the original payment data as well was implemented. As of
          v3.0 an order can only be split once creating a child and a parent order. The
          original shipping stays with the parent order, but the payment is divided
          between the child and the parent based on the remaining order balance in both.
          Gift certificates and other discounts were not fully tested as to how they
          would be split across the parent and child orders. Order with giftcertificates
          and discounts may still required some editing to correct the balances of the
          parent and child orders.</p>

          <p>The original FULL order amount is clearly displayed on both the parent and
          child order along with the original FULL payment information. Additionally
          child orders where the original order was paid via PayPal, Authorize.net, or
          Linkpoint no longer erroneously display the "Grey Box" payments notification
          area.<br />
          <br />
          Now is there a way to keep the original ability to split an order multiple
          times, apply the correct shipping to each order, apply the payments, GVs,
          credit, taxes, and still provide a method to reconcile all the orders? Oh most
          definitely, but it would require a fair bit of work to execute a complete
          re-tooling of the split orders functionality.. AND when this work is being done
          as a free contribution frankly it becomes a matter of who has bandwidth
          available to make all the necessary changes to support this.. So instead a
          simpler solution in order to solve most of the major problems identified was
          implemented. For now, those seeking a more sophisticated split orders
          functionality should seek the services of a developer to create this
          functionaity. oDesk, Elancer, and vWorker are resources that can assist in this
          regard.</p>

          <p><strong>ABOUT ORDER EDITING:</strong> Integrating full order edit
          functionality within Super Orders is a major undertaking and was never been
          fully developed in any version. Previous versions of Super Orders releases
          included some very BASIC order editing features that were adapted from an EARLY
          version of <strong>Edit Orders</strong>. The customer and order total edit
          functionality has been deprecated in this version. For those who require more
          comprehensive order edit functionality, this version of Super Orders now
          includes easy integration with <strong>Edit Orders v4.0.0</strong></p>

          <legend>Super Orders Payment/Refunds Entry</legend>

          <p>Super Orders includes a rudimentary accounting function which gives
          shopowners the ability to enter and track order payment. The Super Orders
          payment system can track all of the following scenarios:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Multiple PO's</li>

            <li>Multiple payments</li>

            <li>Multiple payments per PO</li>

            <li>Multiple refunds per payment</li>

            <li>Multiple refunds per order</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Opening the details screen for any order will display the payment system.
          There you'll find buttons to add the three types of payment data:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Purchase Orders</li>

            <li>Payments</li>

            <li>Refunds</li>
          </ul><br />
          <small><strong>Figure 4</strong></small><br />
          <img src="images/admin_payments.png" border="1" alt="" /><br />
          <br />

          <p>Clicking any one will bring up a pop-up window to enter the details for that
          particular payment entry type. When you are done, the popup will close and
          return you to the original page, refreshing it to display your new entry.</p>

          <p>One of the nice parts of this feature is that the refunds function allows
          you to optionally link a refund to a specific exisitng payment entry.</p>

          <p>Buttons to edit and delete payments are on the line listing the payment.
          Click the corresponding button to modify the entry or remove it entirely. It's
          pretty self-explanatory, but please post on the forum thread if you have
          problems or questions.</p>

          <p>Super Orders will auto enter a Super Orders payment record for orders paid
          via <img src="images/new.jpg" border="0" width="20" alt="" />&nbsp;PayPal,
          Authorize.net, and Linkpoint. All other payment types will require you to enter
          a Super Orders payment record manually</p>

          <p><strong>ABOUT AUTOMATED SUPER ORDERS REFUNDS:</strong><br />
          While Super Orders will auto enter a Super Orders payment record for orders
          paid via <img src="images/new.jpg" border="0" width="20" alt="" />&nbsp;PayPal,
          Authorize.net, and Linkpoint, the automation of Super Orders refund records for
          PayPal, Authorize.net and Linkpoint admin generated refund transactions is a
          major undertaking.<br />
          <br />
          The method required for generating automated Super Orders refund records for
          PayPal paid orders is different than the method required for generating
          automated Super Orders refunds for Authorize.net and Linkpoint. Therefore this
          feature is not included. There are posts in the Super Orders v2.0, v3.0, and
          v4.0 support threads which discuss how to add this functionality to Super
          Orders for PayPal transactions only. We have chosen not to implement this
          feature (auto-refunds) unless it can be implemented for <strong>ALL</strong>
          payment methods which are supported by automated payment records. This keeps
          Super Orders and it's functionality CONSISTENT for a larger variety of
          shopowners versus providing functionality that is beneficial to only ONE group
          of shopowners. That said if you require automated Super Orders refunds
          functionality for PayPal transactions please do try one of the posted solutions
          (look for carlvt88's posts on this topic)<br />
          <br />

          <legend>Language Support for Payment Types</legend>

          <p>The payment system part of Super Orders was built based on English being the
          primary language in the store and doesn't fully work properly with languages
          other than English.</p>

          <p>Here's what happens currently when you add a new payment type in a different
          language:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>In testing the payment types we discovered that adding NEW payment types
            for all active languages works as expected.. You simply add the Payment Type
            code and the Payment Type name for each supported language.</p>

            <p>However EDITING payments types is where it gets strange.. The edit screen
            appears to allow you to edit the payment type for all supported languages in
            tyour store, However, what is ACTUALLY displayed appears to be duplicates of
            the Payment Type for only one elanguage repeated in each of the form
            fields</p>

            <p>If you edit the payment type it will only update for the Payment Type for
            the language currently active, and in order for the change to save, you must
            enter your change in the LAST input box REGARDLESS of whether it's the
            correct one for the currently active language. Furthermore, you cannot use
            the same Payment Type code for each language (which is REQUIRED if you want
            auto payments for PayPal and Credit Card payments to work with ALL active
            languages)</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>This flaw may be fully addressed in a future release. Until this is
          addressed and fixed it, there is a farily easy workaround which involves adding
          the payment types for other languages directly to the database. The Super
          Orders install package includes a sample script which allows you to add
          additional Super Orders payment types. You need to make the correct
          translations and change the language ID to match the language ID for the
          language you are adding. ie: If you are adding French payment types and your
          French language ID = 2, then change the language ID in the script to 2, and
          update all the payment types to the correct translations required. Then using
          the Admin SQL installer, run your the script to add these payment types to the
          database.</p>

          <p>There is a small database change to update one of the table indexes that
          must be made BEFORE uploading your payment types to allow multiple languages to
          share the same payment type code. Without this index modification, the auto
          payments feature for Super Orders WILL NOT work for PayPal or credit card
          payments. (the auto pay code is dependent on the Super Orders payment type code
          matching the credit card codes used in the Zen Cart checkout class files).</p>

          <p>This script is down and dirty, and it has not been tested thoroughly so
          PLEASE backup your database before trying this. This way if you have issues,
          you can simply rollback. However, this is pretty straight forward and should
          get you going if you need payment types for other languages in your store.</p>

          <p><span class="boldemphasis">A quick note on the PDF packingslips:</span></p>

          <p>A packingslip is defined as: <span class="emphasis"><em>A statement of the
          contents of a container, usually put into the container so that the quantity of
          merchandise may be counted by the person who opens the
          container.</em></span></p>

          <p>A few folks have made a BIG deal about the fact that the Super Orders PDF
          packingslips includes pricing information. This is not unusual as many large
          retailers also send out packingslips which include pricing information. The
          point here is that there is NO RULE that says a packingslip CANNOT include
          pricing information. It's called a DETAILED packingslip which serves as a
          packingslip and receipt for an order.</p>

          <p>Now is there a way to make the display of prices an admin configurable
          option so that shopowners can choose whether to display prices or not on the
          PDF packingslip? Sure, but the PDF packingslip code was generously contributed
          by another community member, and it wasn't written this way. This code was
          contributed as is, and there are no plans to modify it this time. When this
          work is being done as a FREE contribution, frankly it becomes a matter of who
          has bandwidth available to make these changes. For now, those who would like

          <p>This report displays all your outstanding payment paperwork. Each radio
          button will search for orders that are missing the indicated transaction piece
          (e.g. searching "Purchase Orders" will display orders in which the customer
          chose to pay via PO but has not submitted a PO yet).</p>

          <p>By default it will look for orders older than 30 days without the specified
          information (typical timeframe to define a payment as "late"), but you can
          include orders within 30 days by clicking the indicated box.</p>

          <p>The print format is just as its name implies, prints nicely on 8.5" x 11"
          paper. You can click the title in the print format to return to the regular
          admin display.</p>

        <fieldset>
          <legend>Cash Flow</legend>

          <p>Location: <strong>Admin &gt; Reports &gt; Cash Report</strong></p>

          <p>Similar to the "Awaiting Payment" report, the Cash Report displays all the
          actual monetary transactions entered into the payment system.</p>

          <p>Your options are payments (income), refunds (loss), or both. PO's are not an
          option because they are merely a promise to pay, not actual cash. Payments
          attached to PO's are included in the "Payments" search.</p>

          <p>The date range search reflects the date upon which the payment or refund was
          entered, NOT the order date, date of a particular status, etc. This date is
          displayed on the order detail page on the payment line item under the heading
          "Date Posted".</p>

          <p>Like the Awaiting Payment report, the print format displays a nice print
          layout. You can also click the title in the print format to return to the
          regular admin display.</p>

        <h3>ADD-ONS INTEGRATION</h3>

        <p>Super Orders now provides an easy means to integrate (no file merging
        required!!) with the following modules:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><img src="images/new.jpg" border="0" width="20" alt="" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit
          Orders</li>

          <li><img src="images/new.jpg" border="0" width="20" alt="" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ty
          Package Tracker</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In order for these modules to work with Super Orders it is presumed that you
        already have these modules installed and working correctly. To use them with
        Super Orders, you only need to turn on the corresponding admin flag - see Figure
        2 &amp; 3 below.</p>

        <p>If you don't have any of these modules installed, but <strong>DO</strong> plan
        to install them to use with Super Orders, we <strong>STRONGLY</strong> suggest
        that you install them <strong>BEFORE YOU INSTALL SUPER ORDERS</strong>. Make sure
        you get them working correctly <strong>FIRST</strong> before you install Super
        Orders.</p>

        <p>Why do we suggest this?? We suggest this so that new shopowners who are
        planning to install these modules can get them working FIRST before installing
        Super Orders. This way you can make sure the base module is installed correctly.
        This gives new shopowners an opportunity to work out all the kinks and issues
        with installation of these mods FIRST so as not to mix apples with oranges by
        thinking that issues with other mods are being caused by Super Orders.</p>

        <p>One last thing...</p>

        <p><strong>PLEASE DO NOT</strong> post regarding questions/issues/errors with
        Edit Orders, or Ty Package Tracker in the Super Orders support threads!!!! You
        will be (politely) redirected to the proper support threads. Thanks for
        understanding..</p>

        <fieldset>
          <legend>Edit Orders Integration</legend>

          <p>If you have Edit Orders v4.0.0 installed you can now enable Edit Orders
          buttons in the Super Orders system to integrate Super Orders with Edit
          Orders.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Install Edit Orders v4.0.0</li>

            <li>Go to <strong>Configuration &gt; Super Orders</strong>. Set the "Edit
            Orders Module Switch" to "True"</li>
          </ol>

          <p>This will enable the Edit Orders v4.0.0 buttons and make them available in
          Super Orders. <strong><span class="c6">DO NOT activate this flag if you do NOT
          have Edit Orders v4.0.0 installed or you WILL get errors in your
          store!!!</span></strong></p>

          <legend>Ty Package Tracker Integration</legend>

          <p>If you have Ty Package Tracker v3.1.2 or greater installed you can now
          enable the Ty Package Tracker fields in the Super Orders system.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Install Ty Package Tracker (v3.1.2 or greater)</li>

            <li>Go to <strong>Configuration &gt; Ty Package Tracker</strong>. Set the "Ty
            Package Tracker Module Switch" to "True".</li>
          </ol>

          <p>This will enable the Ty Package Tracker fields and make them available in
          Super Orders. <strong><span class="c6">DO NOT activate this flag if you do NOT
          have Ty Package Tracker v3.1.2 installed or you WILL get errors in your

            <li>~ PHP 5.3 updates to remove deprecated PHP functions<br />
            ~ Minor change to update the add-on for Zen Cart v1.5.1</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>v4.0.4</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>1. Fixed the error with Shipping Label &amp; Packaging Slip (See #2
            Below).<br />
            2. Changed ALL Files to use Unix (LF Only) Encoding.<br />
            3. Fixed problem with Payment &amp; Purchase Order page not displaying (
            Re-enabled define('FILENAME_SUPER_PAYMENTS) ).<br />
            4. Cleaned up code comments a little bit.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>v4.0.3</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Full integration of Super Orders functionality into the into Zen Cart
            core. Eliminate once and for all the separate Super Orders versions of the
            core "cousin files", and replace the super_orders.php, super_invoice.php,
            super_packingslip.php with Super Order enhanced versions of orders.php,
            invoice.php, &amp; packingslip.php.</li>

            <li>Auto generate Super Orders payment records when orders a paid via
            PayPal</li>

            <li><span class="c7">Credit Card Auto Payment Generation Tweak:</span><br />
            <br />
            I decided to update the class file that auto generates Super Orders payments
            for credit card paid orders based on Blindside's post here:<a href=
            "http://www.zen-cart.com/forum/showpost.php?p=276219&amp;postcount=207"
            target="_blank"><br />
            <br />
            http://www.zen-cart.com/forum/showpost.php?p=276219&amp;postcount=207</a>.
            (just the part of this code which relates to credit payments.. PayPal auto
            payments are handled differently)<br />
            <br />
            I liked the fact that it no longer hardcodes the credit card codes, and
            instead relies on the data in the Super Orders payments types table. IF a NEW
            credit card type is supported by Zen Cart, the only thing Super Orders users
            need to do is to create a corresponding Super Orders payment type (the Super
            Orders payment code must match the corresponding credit card as it does now
            for supported credit cards).. This is loads easier for all I think!!<br />
            <br />
            This will help keep people -- particularly newbies -- "out of the code" just
            to update the module.. Having to edit module files is often where things go
            wrong for newbies.</li>

            <li>Batch Form Printing. When shopowners print multiple invoices they are
            presented with a new window with all the selected invoices in separate
            frames. Printing frames is only supported by IE and Firefox (the 2 most
            commonly used browsers when SO was initially released). This code still
            works, but is showing signs of it's age. (the 80s called..) Frame printing is
            not supported in Chrome, Safari, or Opera. Therefore, this function is to be
            modified so that batch invoices no longer render in frames and the selected
            invoice prints on its own page. Align batch invoices and packingslips so that
            they look/act like the single printed versions.</li>

            <li>Correct PDF packing slip to intepret and output currency and other
            symbols correctly. (trademarks, currency symbols, copyright, etc)</li>

            <li>Eliminate the need for the common_orders_functions.php file. Edit Orders
            and Super Orders should have their own functions files.</li>

            <li>Comments in "Batch Status Update" should work the same way default order
            comments work. (support for e-mail, no e-mail, or hidden comments) . If
            working properly should allow shop owner to create batch hidden order
            comments.<br />
            <br />
            Currently does not create the correct comment type. Hidden comments and no
            e-mail comments are not e-mailed to the customer, but they are stored and
            displayed in the store as if they are e-mail comments.</li>

            <li>PDF Packing Slip now prints comments the same way comments print on the
            regular invoice.</li>

            <li>Correct balance due display on PDF packing slip</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>v3.0.2</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Allowing the use of just range first and/or range last in Batch Status

          <h3>v3.0.1</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Adding a comment to an order with an apostrophe causes SQL failure -
            fixed</li>

            <li>Not installing Ty Tracker means Super Orders Print will fail - fixed</li>

            <li>Display all comments in Invoice</li>

            <li>Display all comments in Packing Slip</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>v3.0.0</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Clean up and reorganize the readme file (again!!!)</li>

            <li>MANY misc bug fixes and corrections</li>

            <li>Overall cleanup of the files to remove deprecated and unused code</li>

            <li>Countries now included as search option in "Batch Form Printing" and
            "Batch Status Updating"</li>

            <li>The "<strong>Edit Status History</strong>" feature has been restored and
            the functionality modified. Editing of order comments is now limited to
            hidden "admin only" comments. Additionally in previous versions of Super
            Orders the "<strong>Edit Status History</strong>" feature inserted HTML and
            ASCII line breaks into the database, and this ugly line break code was
            displayed when the customer viewed their order history from "Status History
            &amp; Comments". This particular problem goes back to 2006, and has now been
            FULLY resolved/addressed.</li>

            <li>Customer comments modified to incorporate the latest Zen Cart 1.3.9
            functionality/format</li>

            <li>Packing slip images are now a simple on/off admin configurable
            option.</li>

            <li>Batch print functionality has been expanded to include PDF invoices!!
            Options for the invoices are admin configurable</li>

            <li>Split orders has been improved to help shopowners easily reconcile a
            split order. Creates a parent and child order. Paid split orders will display
            the grand total paid for both parent and child order. For orders paid via
            PayPal, Authorize.net or Linkpoint, the admin payment panel will not display
            on the child order.</li>

            <li>Order total and customer address edit features have been removed in their
            entirety. (use <strong>Edit Orders</strong> if you need order/customer
            address editing functionality)</li>

            <li>Added missing shortcut icons on the orders listing screen. Now there is a
            corresponding shortcut icon on each order line that matches the buttons that
            appear in the sidebox.</li>

            <li>Restoration of missing default Zen Cart orders.php functionality. This
            now allows payment processor generated (PayPal, Authorize.net or Linkpoint)
            refunds to now be processed within Super Orders. (no longer requires the
            retention of the default orders.php to process PayPal, Authorize.net or
            Linkpoint refunds)</li>

            <li>AUTO PAYMENT FOR ORDERS PAID VIA PAYPAL!!!!!!! 'Nuff said...</li>

            <li>Improved graphics and buttons to <strong>SPRUCE UP</strong> the Super
            Orders UI</li>

            <li>If you have Edit Orders v3.0 installed, you can enable Edit Order in the
            Super Orders admin to enable Edit Orders buttons in Super Orders (No Super
            Orders code merging required.. Simply install Edit Orders and "turn on" Edit
            Orders in the Super Orders admin!!)</li>

            <li>If you have Ty Package Tracker v3.0 installed, you can enable the Ty
            Package Tracker fields for Super Orders (No Super Orders code merging
            required..) Simply install Ty Package Tracker and "turn on" Super Orders from
            the Ty Package Tracker admin!!)</li>

            <li>If you have USPS Click-N-Ship installed, you can enable USPS Click-N-Ship
            in the Super Orders admin to enable USPS Click-N-Ship fields/buttons in Super
            Orders (No Super Orders code merging required.. Simply install USPS
            Click-N-Ship and "turn on" USPS Click-N-Ship in the Super Orders
            admin!!)</li>

            <li>If you have FedEx Automated Labels installed, you can enable FedEx
            Automated Labels in the Super Orders admin to enable FedEx Automated Labels
            buttons in Super Orders (No Super Orders code merging required.. Simply
            install FedEx Automated Labels and "turn on" FedEx Automated Labels in the
            Super Orders admin!!)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>v1.3.9</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Updated for Zen 1.3.9 compatibility</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>v2.0 Rev 48</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Clean up and reorganize the readme file</li>

            <li>Addition of a "<strong>Required_CoreEdits</strong>" folder. This folder
            contains files that include the edits outlined in the the "<strong>REQUIRED
            FILE EDITS</strong>" section of the previous version of the Super Orders
            readme</li>

            <li>Addition of an "<strong>Optional_Files</strong>" set of folders. This
            folder contains files that include most of the edits outlined in the the
            "<strong>OPTIONAL FILE EDITS</strong>" section of the previous version Super
            Orders readme</li>

            <li>Removed all the <strong>authorizenet_aim.php</strong> edits from readme
            because they appear to be from an older version of the Authorize.net payment
            module files. (These instructions are in the "OPTIONAL FILE EDITS" section of
            the previous versions readme file)</li>

            <li>Updated e-mail format (modified lines 30 - 33 of
            <strong>order_status_email.php</strong>) to improve the aesthetics of the
            e-mail generated</li>

            <li>The "<strong>Edit Status History</strong>" function has been removed. It
            creates an audit/accountability issue by allowing the editing of order
            notes/comments. The "<strong>Edit Status History</strong>" feature also
            injects HTML line breaks and ASCII line breaks into the database, and these
            line breaks are displayed when the customer views their order history from
            "Status History &amp; Comments". This particular problem goes back to 2006,
            and has not been fully resolved/addressed even in the last version of Super
            Orders.<br />
            <br />
            The problem is due to the comments not being properly scrubbed before
            inserting them into the DB. This particular issue also is a potential
            security flaw.</li>

            <li>Removed the code in Rev47 which was supposed to correct the customer
            notifications and in particular the behavior of the "<strong>Customer
            Notified</strong>" flag in the "<strong>Status History</strong>" section. The
            "<strong>Customer Notified</strong>" flag did not match the actual activity.
            The Rev47 code did not correct the issue. The code to fix this problem comes
            from the the <strong>super_orders.php</strong> file that comes with Numinix's
            Fast &amp; Easy Checkout. (v1.6.2)</li>

            <li>Changed the packing slip images to an on/off option. (Previous versions
            limited the number of images that would show on a packing slip to 3 -- other
            options for packing slip images are found later in this readme in the Other
            Tips/Edits section)</li>

            <li>Other changes in this version of Super Orders are based on the following
            threads:

              <ol>

                Items 1-3 are all various fixes which corrects the shipping display to
                show the full shipping description (carrier and shipping service) on the
                following files: <strong>super_packingslip.php</strong>,
                <strong>super_invoice.php</strong>, <strong>super_orders.php</strong>,
                and <strong>super_data_sheet.php</strong>. The default Zen Cart packing
                slip, invoice, orders, and datasheet all display the FULL shipping
                description while Super Orders has always used the short shipping
                descriptions. (It is likely that this is because this was a requirement
                of the client for whom this mod was originally built for)</li>

                For products with text attributes that include multiple lines and line
                breaks entered by the customer, the default Zen Cart order invoice prints
                out the text entered by the customer fine, and retains the multiple lines
                and line breaks entered by the customer. However, the Super Orders
                <strong>invoice</strong> does not. This fix addresses that issue. Applied
                this fix to <strong>super_packingslip.php</strong>,
                <strong>super_invoice.php</strong>, <strong>super_orders.php</strong>,
                and <strong>super_data_sheet.php</strong>)</li>

                Corrects an issue where Super Orders fails to update the "last modified
                date" when updating the order status using the batch status update

                Includes an optional edit for the default state of the "<strong>Notify
                Customer</strong>" checkbox</li>

                Addresses another error in Append Comments &amp; Notify Customer as well
                as a clarification on how these features are SUPPOSED to work. Changes to
                language files were made to support this.</li>

                  Fixes issue with Batch Status Updating &amp; Batch Printing which
                  throws errors when you search for orders using the following options:

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>= equals</strong></li>

                    <li><strong>&lt; less than</strong></li>
                  </ul>Because there is an issue with <strong>"= equals"</strong> not
                  working with decimal values (ie: $2.50), the <strong>"=
                  equals</strong>" option will be disabled from the dropdown.

                Fixes the textarea element on super_batch_status.php so it displays
                correctly in Internet Explorer. This is a bug with the way Internet
                Explorer displays textarea elements. The original author of this mod
                posted a hint regarding this issue here: (<a href=
